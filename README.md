# Project for ID2223

This project aims to predict algae bloom in EU bathing sites in the Baltic ocean near the Stockholm area.

Havs och vattenmyndigheter water quality values during the summer. Since no new values are currently updated (December), historical data has been used for making predictions and monitoring. For the water quality values, [FYLL I] has been used. However when using in real-time during the summer, it is suggested to use the predictions that Open-Meteo provides, where coordinates can be entered and marine conditions are returned. It is free to use for non-commercial use (https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/marine-weather-api).
